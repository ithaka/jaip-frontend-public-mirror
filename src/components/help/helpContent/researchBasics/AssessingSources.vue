  <pep-pharos-heading :level="2" preset="5--bold">Assessing Your Sources</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    Once you have received your research materials, it is important to assess whether they are
    trustworthy and credible. This section describes how to identify scholarly source material for
    academic research.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several ways to identify scholarly source material, and a good place to start is by
    examining prospective sources for certain academic attributes. You can think of them as the
    A-B-Cs of scholarly sources.
  </p>
  <p>
    These attributes are helpful in interpreting the level of scholarship. In the lesson ahead,
    we’ll look at sources and point out these attributes so that you can start to identify them on
    your own.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading :level="3" preset="4">Key Indicators</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    An easy way to remember the key indicators of academic scholarship is by using your A-B-Cs:
    <b>authority</b>, <b>bias</b>, and <b>content</b>. Let’s get started by investigating the topic
    of high-stakes testing.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading :level="4" preset="2">Authority</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    To have authority means to be recognized as knowledgeable on a specific topic. There’s a root
    word in “authority” that tells you what you’re going to look at first: “author.” When you’re
    considering a source, try to find the answers to these questions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is the author or authors clearly identified?</li>
    <li>
      Does the author have scholarly credentials, or credentials within the appropriate field of
      expertise?
    </li>
    <li>
      Is the author’s affiliation apparent, such as where he or she works? If the author is a
      professor, are advanced degrees listed alongside his or her academic position?
    </li>
    <li>
      Does the author have qualifications to write on the topic, such as an advanced degree in the
      field with several years of experience and research on the topic?
    </li>
    <li>
      Does the publication have an author and an editor? The presence of an editor might imply a
      collection of articles, as opposed to a single piece by a single person. Be sure to note who
      the piece is actually written by. This should usually be a person in scholarly works with
      appropriate credentials.
    </li>
    <li>
      Occasionally, an organization will serve as the author. In these cases, make sure that the
      organization has expertise and credibility in the field. You can usually determine this by
      reading the organization’s bio, the same way you would read about an author.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Take a look at this excerpt from the sustainability journal
    <i>Consilience: The Journal of Sustainable Development</i>.
  </p>
  <img class="help-tab__image" :src="consilience" alt="Journal of Sustainable Developmen" />
  <p>
    <small
      >Figure 5: Page from <i>Consilience: Journal of Sustainable Development</i> demonstrating
      authorship.</small
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    You can see the authors clearly listed, along with their affiliations and contact details. All
    authors work at well-known institutions, and one is an assistant professor of public affairs.
    These are good indicators that they have authority on this subject.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading :level="4" preset="2">Bias</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    It’s important that academic scholarship is presented in an objective manner without bias. The
    peer review system is an established way to identify biases that might appear in scholarly
    research. In peer review, a work is evaluated by experts and published only if it meets the
    discipline’s standards. It is also a way to ensure objectivity in assessing an academic article.
    The peers selected for the review are:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the same field as the author(s)</li>
    <li>Proven to be objective and independent from the work they are reviewing for publication</li>
    <li>
      Familiar enough with the body of work the article relates to in order to lend credibility to
      the publication of it
    </li>
    <li>Able to make a formal declaration in the work attesting to their neutrality</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In this view from the American Journal of Nursing, you can see a reference to peer review along
    with the information on what the journal stands for and what it looks for in the articles it
    publishes. The journal has greater authority because you can rely on its information being
    unbiased.
  </p>

  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading :level="4" preset="2">Content</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    By examining the content, you can determine an article’s suitability for scholarly research.
    Remember to look not only for relevant topical information, but also signs of scholarship. Here
    are some questions to consider:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Audience</strong>: is the work intended for other scholars or experts in the field?
      Does it use discipline-specific terminology?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Intent</strong>: why is the author publishing the article? Is it a report, a case
      study, or an in-depth analysis of a specific topic?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Level</strong>: does the article assume some basic knowledge on the readers’ part? Is
      it written for peers, or to introduce the topic to laypersons?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Style</strong>: Are there illustrations, charts, and tables? If so, are they relevant
      to the content or are they “eye candy” meant to attract readers?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Tone</strong>: is it written using a professional tone and an academic style, or is it
      colloquial and casual, which is a sign it’s not scholarly?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This excerpt from <em>The Elementary School Journal</em>, provides information on the source’s
    credibility. As a researcher, knowing that the article is credible is just as important as
    finding out what it has to say about high-stakes testing. The title of the journal,
    <em>The Elementary School Journal</em>, doesn’t tell us much about the level of content—but the
    subtitle of the article, “A Framework for Equitable Learning Opportunities,” gives us a clue
    that this article is aimed at readers with some knowledge in the field, not at the general
    public. The article is presented in plain text, without any illustrations. These are all good
    indicators of a credible scholarly source.

  <p><em>The Elementary School Journal page excerpt demonstrating source credibility.</em></p>
  <p>Finally, think about the tone of the abstract. Look at this sentence:</p>
  <figure>
    <img
      :src="ElemSchoolJournalExcerpt"
      class="help-tab__image"
      alt="Elementary School Journal excerpt"
    />

  <p>
    “<em
      >Next, we provide examples of curriculum development and research programs to illustrate key
      components in the theoretical framework and to highlight how these programs address challenges
      in curriculum design and implementation.</em
    >”
  </p>
  <p>
    What are some words that describe the tone of this sentence? You might say it is complex,
    formal, or academic.
  </p>
  <p>Now, look at this excerpt from another source on the topic of teaching science:</p>
  <figure>
    <img :src="EarthScienceWeek" class="help-tab__image" alt="Earth Science Week front page" />
    <p>
      <small>Figure 8: Earth Science Week front page</small>
    </p>
  </figure>
  <p>
    “<em
      >Do the research together with each student recording the information in a chart. Then do a
      quick discussion, ending with safety tips for each type of danger in your area. Have each
      student make a button with a safety tip and wear it this week. Or they could make an Earth
      Science Week button!</em
    >”
  </p>
  <p>
    What are some words to describe the tone of this piece? You might say it is conversational,
    accessible, or straightforward. The casual tone of this writing is one clue that it does not
    come from a scholarly source.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="publisher" :level="4" preset="2">Publisher</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    We’ve discussed authors and their content, so now let’s turn to the publisher that’s responsible
    for the end product. The publisher plays an important role in establishing credibility. Without
    a legitimate publisher, it’s difficult to confirm that a source is credible. When in doubt, look
    to the publisher to help steer you toward a credible source on which to base your scholarly
    work, and search for these clues:<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Does the journal list an editorial board?<br /></li>
    <li>Is there a logo?<br /></li>
    <li>Has the journal won any awards? Is it affiliated with a well-known institution?<br /></li>
    <li>
      Is the blurb on the journal written in a scholarly manner for an academic audience?<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Within a scholarly database listing, you will usually find a link that offers information about
    a journal. Here’s an example from <em>Teaching &amp; Learning Inquiry</em>, published by Indiana
    University Press.
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img :src="IndianaUPress" alt="Indiana University Press" class="help-tab__image" />
    <p><small>Figure 9: Indiana University Press example of publisher information</small></p>
  </figure>
  <p>
    A university affiliation is a good indicator of scholarly content. Notice whether there is a
    logo displaying the name. Information is included on its mission, editors, and editorial board.
    The tone is professional and the style is academic.

  <p>
    Academic endorsement is an important indicator of scholarship. We’ll explore the signs of
    academic endorsement together, and you will learn how to recognize them on your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    We’ll also tackle the concepts of relevance and currency in scholarship. You’ll learn why they
    are important, and how they are different.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="scan" :level="4" preset="2">Scan</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    No one can be expected to read everything while they’re searching for resources, so it’s
    important to practice the art of scanning. If there’s an abstract, scan for keywords: words or
    phrases that relate to your topic and provide clues about the content of the article. Pay
    attention to the A-B-C clues you see (authority, bias, and content). If there is no abstract,
    scan for author, publisher, and keywords. Keywords should not only relate to your topic, but
    also be of a scholarly nature.
  </p>
  <p>
    Get into the habit of “talking to the text” as you scan, whether you’re looking at a computer
    screen or a piece of paper. Highlight important words and phrases, record questions or ideas
    that come up, and make notes about how this material might connect to other things you know.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you were investigating the topic of high-stakes testing, what would you notice about the
    abstract and keywords for this article?
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img
      :src="IssuesHighStakesTesting"
      alt="Elementary School Journal testing"
      class="help-tab__image"
    />
    <p><small>Figure 10: Elementary School Journal testing</small></p>
  </figure>
  <p>
    As you scan this abstract, you might highlight the keywords “high-stakes testing,” which tell
    you that it relates to your topic. You might mark phrases like “qualitative metasynthesis” or
    “template analysis” with a question mark if you’re not sure what they mean. The use of these
    complex and specialized terms indicate that this is a scholarly source. Remember:<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Abstract: If there’s an abstract, read it first, checking for key words and concepts.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      Scan: Even if there isn’t an abstract, scan for keywords and formal language structure.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="references-bibliography" :level="4" preset="2"
    >References: Bibliography</pep-pharos-heading
  >
  <p>
    Other signs of academic endorsement can be found by examining the work’s bibliography. Review
    your sources’ reference information to find signs of academic endorsement.
  </p>
  <p>
    Look at the bibliography: is the article formulated from other scholarship? If there is no
    bibliography, that could be a sign that a source is not scholarly.
  </p>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="currency" :level="4" preset="2">Currency</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    Once you’ve determined that a work is scholarly, it’s important that you make sure the sources
    you use are also current and relevant. When you assess the currency of a source, you’re asking,
    “How new is this information? Has anything changed since this was published?”
  </p>
  <p>Here are a few clues that can help you decide whether a source is current.<br /></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Publication or revision date: does the source have one? If not, you really have no way to tell
      whether it’s outdated. A scholarly source should always include a publication date.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      How recent are the publication dates of the works cited in its bibliography? If a new article
      cites only articles from 20 years ago, consider whether it might be omitting more recent
      sources.<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      Has the information been revised, updated, or retracted? Is newer information available?<br />
    </li>
    <li>
      Also consider your topic: is information about it still changing or being discovered,such as
      in the fields of medicine or technology? If so, you may want to look for only very current
      sources. On the other hand, if you are writing about an event in ancient history, it may be
      fine to use older sources.<br />
    </li>
  </ul>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="relevance" :level="4" preset="2">Relevance</pep-pharos-heading>
  <p>
    The question of relevance is one that only you can answer: how useful is a source for your
    purpose?<br />
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Is it written at an appropriate level?<br /></li>
    <li>Is it too broad or too specific?<br /></li>
    <li>Does it answer a question or fill a need in your research?<br /></li>
    <li>Does it add something new?<br /></li>
  </ul>
  <pep-pharos-heading id="references-citations" :level="4" preset="2"
    >References: Citations</pep-pharos-heading
  >
  <p>
    Check for citations within the text of the article. Have the authors backed up their statements
    with references to other scholarly sources?
  </p>
  <figure>
    <img :src="InArticleCitation" alt="Citations within an article" class="help-tab__image" />
    <p><small>Figure 11: Example of an article with citations in the text</small></p>
  </figure>
  <p>
    You can see that this author is citing research that supports her statements. This tells you
    that her assertions are based on study in the field, and it indicates that other scholars share
    her views. This foundation is a good indicator of scholarly content. If the author provides no
    citations, it could be a sign that the source is not scholarly.
  </p>
  <p>
    In many cases, you can also find out who is citing the source you’re looking at. If other
    scholars are using it as a source in their own research, that could be a sign of a
    well-respected scholarly source. This is called a “cited by search” or a “reverse citation
    search.” Many databases provide a link to this search from an article’s citation page.
