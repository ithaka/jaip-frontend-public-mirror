Despite this rationale for continued animal experimentation, shortcomings of this practice have become increasingly more apparent and well-documented. However, these limitations are not yet widely known or appreciated, and there is a danger that they may simply be ignored. The 51 experts who have contributed to Animal Experimentation: Working Towards a Paradigm Change critically review current animal use in science, present new and innovative non-animal approaches to address urgent scientific questions, and offer a roadmap towards an animal-free world of science.</p>",

With the employment of designed questionnaires and computer-based spoken English test, this paper explored test anxiety manifestation of Chinese college students from both macro and micro aspects, and found out that the major anxiety in computer-based spoken English test was spoken English test anxiety, which consisted of test anxiety and communication apprehension. Regard to proximal test anxiety, the causes listed in proper order as low spoken English abilities, lack of speaking techniques, anxiety from the evaluative process and inadaptability with computer-based spoken English test format. As to distal anxiety causes, attitude toward learning spoken English and self-evaluation of speaking abilities were significantly negatively correlated with test anxiety. Besides, as test anxiety significantly associated often with test performance, a look at pedagogical implications has been discussed in this paper.",

In the present investigation, 568 racially and socioeconomically diverse students in grades 9-12 preparing to take statewide examinations completed measures of test perception, test anxiety, test attitudes, and study skills. Results associate higher levels of test anxiety with greater pressure from parents and teachers, poor time management, decreased ability to maintain attention, mind-blanking on tests, and lower test confidence. However, greater perceived pressure from parents and teachers is positively related to good study habits, and parental pressure is predictive of material knowledge.",

      "abstract": "This study examined test-takers' motivation, test anxiety, and test performance across a range of social and educational contexts in three high-stakes language tests: the Canadian Academic English Language (CAEL) Assessment in Canada, the College English Test (CET) in the People's Republic of China, and the General English Proficiency Test (GEPT) in Taiwan. The researchers issued a questionnaire exploring motivation, test anxiety, and perceptions of test importance and purpose to test-takers in each of the three contexts. A total of 1,281 valid questionnaire responses were obtained: 255 from CAEL, 493 from CET, and 533 from GEPT. Questionnaire responses were linked to each test-taker's respective test performance. The results illustrate complex interrelationships of test-takers' motivation and test anxiety in their test performance. Differences in motivation and test anxiety emerged with regard to social variables (i.e., test importance to stakeholders and test purposes). Further, motivation and test anxiety, along with personal variables (i.e., gender and age), were associated with test performance. Given that motivation and test anxiety have typically been examined separately and in relation to a single testing context, this study addresses an important research gap.",
