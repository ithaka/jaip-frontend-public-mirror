            "abstract": "This qualitative study examined the experiences of formerly incarcerated students in community colleges. In this study, participants described how they made meaning of their postsecondary education experience through their decision to start college, the college preparation, and faculty interactions that collectively influenced their academic pathways. The students of this study were formerly incarcerated Latino men enrolled in California community colleges located in northern, central, and southern regions. This study specifically sought to challenge the stigma that revolves around the experiences of the carceral system leading to a deficit perspective on this student population. The findings from this study aligns with the academic support services for this student population in higher education.",

Amid an ongoing pandemic, people across the globe wrote, read, and revised thought-provoking pieces in hopes that they would transform one’s thoughts. This Special Issue predominately features articles authored by individuals impacted by incarceration to provide those closest to the issues with a platform to recommend solutions. Everything I am writing is from personal experiences, watching news, and hearing staff at numerous facilities. I was not able to do any research at the facility library or through assistance from the education program/school due to the short staff. I had to write something. Hopefully, it can be for some use, all I want is to provide some info to try to help my fellow inmates because things are becoming worst in prison and in society.",

Having White allies teach in HEP programs is significant, but the impact of seeing Black faculty who possess post-secondary degrees and prominent positions in the community (Turner & Grauerholz, 2017) is especially imperative and can be inspiring for this student population. As a former Academic Coordinator for a HEP program where the majority of the student body is comprised of people of color, I believe faculty of color, as well as faculty who are directly impacted by the legal system, need to be recruited on a larger scale.",

            "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic bifurcated and disrupted the 2019 and 2020 academic years. Moving forward it seems clear that we will delineate our time in terms of “before the pandemic” and “after the pandemic.” This distinction resonates with faculty and alumni of the University of Iowa’s (UI) Liberal Arts Beyond Bars (LABB) college in prison program for reasons beyond the COVID-19 virus. On March 9, 2020, the Iowa Department of Corrections suspended all in-person volunteer activity and family visits for people incarcerated in the state of Iowa. Additionally, in May of 2020 new leadership was installed at the Iowa Medical and Classification Center (IMCC) prison. Under the prior warden the UI LABB program had access to a computer lab where students could log on to the browser-based University of Iowa Learning Management System (called ICON — Iowa Classes On-Line) and interact with their coursework, faculty, and LABB staff. This system of communication kept us connected, even when we could not be in the same physical space. This personal narrative exchange arises from themes mined from that specific correspondence between the authors from March 10, 2020, the first day after all visitors and volunteers were locked out due to COVID protocols, and August 18, 2020, when the college program’s computer lab was dismantled, and communication severed. Themes within this correspondence speak to the difficulties of communicating from a prison, especially during a global pandemic, as well as to the ways racism manifests in higher education in prison programs. Additional discussions about the challenges of maintaining mental health under the care of prison health providers and during the exacerbation of isolation and tension unique to quarantine are also presented [TRIGGER WARNING – this article contains references to suicide, trauma, and other issues of mental health and wellness.]",

Rather than collapsing sissiness into homosexuality,\nRoss shows how sissiness constitutes a historically fluid range of\ngender practices that are expressed as a physical manifestation,\ndiscursive epithet, social identity, and political phenomenon. He\nreconsiders several black leaders, intellectuals, musicians, and\nathletes within the context of sissiness, from Booker T.\nWashington, George Washington Carver, and James Baldwin to Little\nRichard, Amiri Baraka, and Wilt Chamberlain. Whether examining\nWashington's practice of cleaning as an iteration of sissiness,\nBaldwin's self-fashioned sissy deportment, or sissiphobia in\nprofessional sports and black nationalism, Ross demonstrates that\nsissiness can be embraced and exploited to conform to American\ngender norms or disrupt racialized patriarchy. In this way,\nsissiness constitutes a central element in modern understandings of\nrace and gender.\n</p>",

In the\nprocess, these writers highlighted the extents to which places and\nspaces shaped or situated racial representations.

Their friendship began at Harvard and\nOxford during the years 1906 through 1908 and was rekindled during\nthe Great Depression, growing stronger until Locke's death in 1954.\nTo Locke and Kallen, friendship itself was a metaphor for cultural\npluralism, exemplified by people who found common ground while\nappreciating each other's differences. Weinfeld demonstrates how\nthis understanding of cultural pluralism offers a new vision for\ndiverse societies across the globe. <em>An American Friendship</em>\nprovides critical background for understanding the conflicts over\nidentity politics that polarize US society today.</p>\n</p>",

In this definitive biography, the first\nfull-scale life of Dunbar in half a century, Gene Andrew Jarrett\noffers a revelatory account of a writer whose Gilded Age celebrity\nas the \"poet laureate of his race\" hid the private struggles of a\nman who, in the words of his famous poem, felt like a \"caged bird\"\nthat sings. Jarrett tells the fascinating story of how Dunbar, born\nduring Reconstruction to formerly enslaved parents, excelled\nagainst all odds to become an accomplished and versatile artist. A\nprolific and successful poet, novelist, essayist, playwright, and\nBroadway librettist, he was also a friend of such luminaries as\nFrederick Douglass and Orville and Wilbur Wright. But while\naudiences across the United States and Europe flocked to enjoy his\nliterary readings, Dunbar privately bemoaned shouldering the burden\nof race and catering to minstrel stereotypes to earn fame and\nmoney. Inspired by his parents' survival of slavery, but also\nagitated by a turbulent public marriage, beholden to influential\nbenefactors, and helpless against his widely reported bouts of\ntuberculosis and alcoholism, he came to regard his racial notoriety\nas a curse as well as a blessing before dying at the age of only\nthirty-three. Beautifully written, meticulously researched, and\ngenerously illustrated, this biography presents the richest, most\ndetailed, and most nuanced portrait yet of Dunbar and his work,\ntransforming how we understand the astonishing life and times of a\ncentral figure in American literary history.</p>\n</p>",
