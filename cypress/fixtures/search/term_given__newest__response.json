As a house for\nthe struggle, the buildings of publications like <em>Ebony</em> and\nthe <em>Chicago Defender</em> embodied narratives of racial uplift\nand community resistance. As political hubs, gallery spaces, and\npublic squares, they served as key sites in the ongoing Black quest\nfor self-respect, independence, and civic identity. At the same\ntime, factors ranging from discriminatory business practices to\neditorial and corporate ideology prescribed their location, use,\nand appearance, positioning Black press buildings as sites of both\nBlack possibility and racial constraint. \n\n<p>Engaging and innovative, <em>A House for the Struggle</em>\nreconsiders the Black press's place at the crossroads where\naspiration collided with life in one of America's most segregated\ncities.</p>\n</p>",

Downtown buildings-once\ncourthouses, movie theaters, post offices, and gas stations-are now\nchic showroom spaces, even as many sit empty between each\nexposition.</p>\n\n<p>In <em>Showroom City</em>, John Joe Schlichtman applies an\nethnographic lens to the global exposition's relationship with High\nPoint after it defeated rival Chicago in the 1960s and established\nitself as the world's dominant furniture center. In recent decades,\nfollowing trends in global finance, private equity firms were\nincreasingly behind downtown High Point's real estate transactions,\ncoordinated by buyers far removed from the region. Then, in one\nmassive transaction in 2011, a firm funded by Bain Capital\npurchased every major showroom building, and the majority of\ndowntown real estate was under one owner.</p>\n\n<p><em>Showroom City</em> is a story of exclusionary growth and\nunchecked development, of a city flailing to fill the void left by\nits dwindling factories. But beyond that Schlichtman engages the\ngeneral lessons behind both High Point's deindustrialization and\nits stunning reinvention as a furniture fashion, merchandising, and\ndesign node. With great nuance, he delves deeply to reveal how\npower operates locally and how citizens may affirm, exploit,\ninfluence, and resist the takeover of their community.</p>\n</p>",

Rebecca Sharpless here weaves a brilliant chronicle, vast in perspective and entertaining in detail, revealing how three global food traditions-Indigenous American, European, and African-collided with and merged in the economies, cultures, and foodways of the South to create what we know as the southern baking tradition. Recognizing that sentiments around southern baking run deep, Sharpless takes delight in deflating stereotypes as she delves into the surprising realities underlying the creation and consumption of baked goods. People who controlled the food supply in the South used baking to reinforce their power and make social distinctions. Who used white cornmeal and who used yellow, who put sugar in their cornbread and who did not had traditional meanings for southerners, as did the proportions of flour, fat, and liquid in biscuits. By the twentieth century, however, the popularity of convenience foods and mixes exploded in the region, as it did nationwide. Still, while some regional distinctions have waned, baking in the South continues to be a remarkable, and remarkably tasty, source of identity and entrepreneurship.</p>",

Drawing on\nnever-before-seen archival documents as well as scores of new\ninterviews, Murphy shows how discriminatory public policy and\npersonal prejudice combined to create the racially segregated\neducation system that exists in the Rochester area today. Alongside\nthis dismal history, Murphy recounts the courageous fight for\nintegration and equality, from the advocacy of Frederick Douglass\nin the 1850s to a countywide student coalition inspired by the\nBlack Lives Matter movement in the 2010s. This grinding antagonism,\nfeaturing numerous failed efforts to uphold the promise of Brown v.\nBoard of Education, underlines that desegregation and integration\noffer the greatest opportunity to improve educational and economic\noutcomes for children of color in the United States. To date, that\nopportunity has been lost in Rochester, and persistent poor\nacademic outcomes have been one terrible result. <em>Your Children\nAre Very Greatly in Danger</em> is a history of Rochester with\nclear relevance for today. The struggle for equity in Rochester,\nlike in many northern cities, shows how the burden of history lies\non the present. A better future for these cities requires grappling\nwith their troubled pasts. Murphy's account is a necessary\ncontribution to twenty-first-century Rochester.</p>\n</p>",

So how did the\nregion become the stronghold of conservative Republicans in thrall\nto Donald Trump? After a lifetime studying Southern politics,\nAnthony Badger has come to a provocative conclusion: white liberals\nfailed because they put their faith in policy solutions as an\nengine for social change and were reluctant to confront directly\nthe explosive racial politics dividing their constituents. After\nWorld War II, many Americans believed that if the edifice of racial\nsegregation, white supremacy, and voter disfranchisement could be\ndismantled across the South, the forces of liberalism would\nprevail. Hopeful that economic modernization and education would\nbring about gradual racial change, Southern moderates were rattled\nwhen civil rights protest and federal intervention forced their\nhand. Most were fatalistic in the face of massive resistance. When\nthe end of segregation became inevitable, it was largely driven by\nactivists and mediated by Republican businessmen. Badger follows\nthe senators who refused to sign the Southern Manifesto and\nrejected Nixon's Southern Strategy. He considers the dilemmas\nliberals faced across the South, arguing that their failure cannot\nbe blamed simply on entrenched racism. Conservative triumph was not\ninevitable, he argues, before pointing to specific false steps and\nmissed opportunities. Could the biracial coalition of low-income\nvoters that liberal politicians keep counting on finally\nmaterialize? Badger sees hope but urges Democrats not to be too\ncomplacent.\n</p>",

Hence diplomacy and the forces of capitalism have\ncontinually evolved together and shaped each other at different\nlevels of international, national, and local transformations.\n<em>Diplomacy and Capitalism</em> focuses on the crucial questions\nof wealth and power in the United States and the world in the\ntwentieth century. Through a series of wide-ranging case studies on\nthe history of international political economy and its array of\nstate and non-state actors, the volume's authors analyze how\nmaterial interests and foreign relations shaped each other. How did\nthe rising and then disproportionate power of the United States and\nthe actions of corporations, creditors, diplomats, and soldiers\nshape the twentieth-century world? How did officials in the United\nStates and other nations understand the relationship between\nforeign investment and the state? How did people outside of the\nUnited States respond to and shape American diplomacy and\npolitical-economic policy? In detailed discussions of the exchanges\nand entanglements of capitalism and diplomacy, the authors answer\nthese crucial questions. In doing so, they excavate how different\ncombinations of material interest, geopolitical rivalry, and\nideology helped create the world we live in today. The book thus\nanalyzes competing and shared visions of international capitalism\nand U.S. diplomatic influence in chapters that bring the book's\nreaders from the dawn of the twentieth century to its end, from\nTheodore Roosevelt to Ronald Reagan.

Although scholars have tended to describe the years between the end of World War II and the 1960s as an “Age of Consensus,” historian Thomas Sugrue has argued that it is best understood as “an era of brutality, of attempts to silence dissent.”¹ Government loyalty investigations and a resurgent form of business-friendly liberalism curtailed challenges from the left, destroying coalitions and individuals on the way.

          "book_description": "<p>In an era defined by political polarization, both major U.S. parties have come to share a remarkably similar understanding of the education system as well as a set of punitive strategies for fixing it. Combining an intellectual history of social policy with a sweeping history of the educational system, Daniel S. Moak looks beyond the rise of neoliberalism to find the origin of today's education woes in Great Society reforms. In the wake of World War II, a coalition of thinkers gained dominance in U.S. policymaking. They identified educational opportunity as the ideal means of addressing racial and economic inequality by incorporating individuals into a free market economy. The passage of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) in 1965 secured an expansive federal commitment to this goal. However, when social problems failed to improve, the underlying logic led policymakers to hold schools responsible. Moak documents how a vision of education as a panacea for society's flaws led us to turn away from redistributive economic policies and down the path to market-based reforms, No Child Left Behind, mass school closures, teacher layoffs, and other policies that plague the public education system to this day.</p>",
